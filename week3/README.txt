main.c contains the human readable code.

The pupose of this script is to approoximate the are under the curve using the trapezoidal method 

The script outputs the "Area" which is obtained from the trapezoidal method and "log(2)" which should be the analytical solution to the area under the curve of tan(x) 0-->pi/3

This facilitates comparison between the analytical method and the numerical method.
