matmult.c contains the human readable code for this weeks practicle. It should be noted that much of the code is from the tuesday tutorial but my own comments to aid in understanding have been applied.

The folder labelled step6 contains the Makefile which was used to combine main.o and matmult.o into one machine readable/executable file.
